/**
 * The MatrixDisplay program:
 * This game sequence starts with configuration for a player to choose the minimum value, maximum value, and maximum number of tries.
 * The game accepts an integer input within the provided range in the configuration (inclusive).
 * The game will generate a random integer within the range received in the configuration.
 * Players need to input the exact same integer in order to win the game.
 * If the players have reached their maximum tries without winning, they lose the game.
 * Players can review their previous guesses by interacting with the post-game prompt.
 * On post-game prompt exit, the game will log the answer, number of tries, and win/lose status.
 * Then they can choose to replay the game or quit by interacting with the prompt.
 * If they quit, the game will terminate with a statistics report.
